# Simulating Molecular Nonadiabatic Alignment

## Overview
This repository provides source code for simulating molecular nonadiabatic alignment. The program numerically solves the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE) to calculate the temporal evolution of a molecular rotational wave packet. It supports simulations for both polar and nonpolar linear molecules, offering versatility and reliability in studying laser-matter interactions.

## Features
- Simulates the alignment process for both polar and nonpolar molecules.
- Handles user-defined molecular parameters.
- Verified against reliable theoretical studies.

## Methodology
The simulation involves:
1. **Laser Field Interaction**: The molecular wave packet evolves under the influence of a linearly polarized laser field, modeled using a Gaussian pulse envelope.
2. **Field-Free Evolution**: After the laser pulse ends, the wave packet propagates in the absence of a field, allowing for the calculation of molecular alignment over time.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


## Usage
1. Modify `input.json` to define custom molecular parameters or laser settings.
  *`"laser"`: define laser parameters
    -`"intensity"`: laser intensity ($10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$);
    -`"fwhm"`: 'full width height max' of laser duration (fs);
    -`"step"`: number of steps for laser duration

2. Run `hcmue_alignment.exe`


## Results
The simulation outputs include:
- `degree_of_alignment.csv` data of $\langle \cos^2 \theta \rangle(t)$ as a function of time.
- `degree_of_alignment.png` figure of $\langle \cos^2 \theta \rangle(t)$ as a function of time.
- `distribution.png` distribution of $J_{max}$ states.
